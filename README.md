Studies have shown that the compressive strength of concrete is a highly non- linear function of the age and ingredients of the concrete. This is a 
model built to predict the compressive strength of concrete using its age and ingredients as regressors. 

A Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline model with Interaction terms provides an R^2 value of 87.4% whereas an ensemble random forest regression model 
explains 92.43% of the variance in the response variable.
